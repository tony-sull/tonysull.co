Today, we are proud to launch [The Astro Showcase](https://astro.build/showcase): a place to explore beautiful community websites built with Astro. Use the showcase for inspiration, or just to check out whatâ€™s possible in Astro. We are proud to be powering the teams behind these awesome sites, including [Google Firebase](https://firebase.blog/), [Trivago](https://tech.trivago.com/), [The Guardian](https://developers.theguardian.com/), [Daily Dev Tips](https://daily-dev-tips.com/) and more.
