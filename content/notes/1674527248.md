The gaslight in here is completely insane.  We spent a year and a half with social media closing accounts for comparing Covid-19 to the flu, likely at the direct request of the federal government. Now the FDA is pushing to treat Covid under the same process as the flu and NPR happily shared this without any mention of the 180 degree turn in policy?
