Using the latest frameworks & libraries can absolutely help you ship faster

Once it's shipped though, you have much less tech debt if you stuck with "boring" tech

I've got a hunch there's a strong correlation between # of dependencies and faith in the product-market fit

To the end, if love to see a "feature complete" flag similar to deprecation warnings

Would be handy to know a dependency is still actively maintained _and_ the API won't break on me later
