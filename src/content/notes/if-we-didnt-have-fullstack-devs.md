If "fullstack dev" wasn't a thing, would tools like Tailwind and NextJS still be popular?

If a new hire dev needs to manage everything from the database to CSS, of course they'll reach for magic solutions that promise to do everything.

I can't help but think these tools were reactions to the industry abandoning specialization.
