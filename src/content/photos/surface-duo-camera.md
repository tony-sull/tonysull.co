Surface Duo got a lot of shit for having a terrible camera -- I'm really surprised with how much better Microsoft managed to make it through software updates alone

This photo is straight out of the original Duo's camera app. Heavy handed with the fake bokeh, but I really didn't do it any favors pointing straight at the evening sun
